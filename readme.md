## About

This app is intended to be simple and easy to use, so less is more (UI and UX).

## Collaboration

* Make new branches from `production` branch to begin coding from the last up to date code.
* Notation for new features is `feature-something` for example `feature-new-blinds-config-layout`.
* Notation for bug fixes or refactors is `fix-something` for example `fix-notif-time`.
* Pull requests must be done to `alpha` branch. So it can be uploaded as an alpha release on Google Play.
* Once `alpha` branch is tested, it'll be merged into `beta` branch and released as beta on Google Play.
* Once `beta` branch is tested, it'll be merged into `production` branch and released as final on Google Play.
